# LDscaff
LDscaff: LD-based scaffolding of de novo genome assemblies


We propose LDscaff for draft genome assembly incorporating linkage disequilibrium information in population data. LDscaff aids in the layout of a set of scaffolds with a graph method, by taking as input the population variation data, a set of scaffolds, to build an undirected graph with a set of vertices and edges, representing the scaffolds and the LD strength among them. Computing the optimal orders and orientations of these scaffolds can be treated as a maximum weight matching problem.
