Usage:

Step1: Prepare snps record for each contig, each contig should contains two files: .snp1 and .snp2
Step2: Use LDscaff to build a graph, with nodes represented by contig ends, 
    with edges represented by possible links between two contig ends, 
    with weights represented by LD bwtween two contig ends.
    Here, we resolve the matching problems by solving the maximum matching problem.
    We now obtain the best matching the contains several paths.
Step3: Use a cut-off to break the weak links and obtain the final results.
